						<h2>My Blog</h2>
						<h1>Here you will be able to read my blog posts! I'll try to update it often.</h1>
						<p> Welcome!
This is my first post on this blog, a project I’ve wanted to start for a long time. I’ve always wanted a space where I can freely express my thoughts, so I decided to create this little corner of the internet. Building this site took me over a year since I wrote most of the code myself. I have no background in computer science, but here we are—learning as we go. If you notice any errors, well, now you know why. What matters to me is that I set a goal for myself, and I’m stubborn enough to see it through because having my own space and creative freedom is something I truly value.
Since this is my first post, I guess I should introduce myself. I’m 19 years old, I don’t have a favorite color, and I’m passionate about food, fútbol (Visca Barça!), reading (fantasy, dystopian, romance), and music. Some of my favorite artists are Latin Mafia, NSQK, Bad Bunny, Rosalía, and Karol G—but honestly, I listen to a bit of everything. I’m also a coffee addict and would do anything for good sushi. If you love Pinterest as much as I do, you can find me there too.
I’m currently studying at NYU, a university full of opportunities—one I never imagined myself attending, yet here I am. I’ve spent most of my life between Los Angeles and Mexico, so adjusting to New York’s cold weather has been a struggle.
As for this blog, expect a little bit of everything. I’ll be sharing topics that interest me, and we’ll see where this space takes us. Stay tuned!
